# Relay Hub

relay.cc is the place to find and communicate with web3 profiles and web3 apps. 

Priority 0: We have directories for apps in interesting sectors of web3, and provide the way to message them through the open-source Receiver chatbox. examples: lensgarden.xyz , https://dappradar.com. 

P0: We have user profiles that aggregate app card data, DID data, ZK data, onchain data (NFT, tokens), and are meant to be shared in-person and online. A way to message the profile is through Receiver. examples: light.so/seanwbren.eth , https://seanwbren.eth.limo , https://www.walletscan.info/ 

P1: We have a fullscreen UI for messaging (traditional 3 column view with conversation list, conversation, contact). examples: telegram on desktop, twitter on desktop)

Three major goals:
1) Serve as the premier example of XMTP messaging with Receiver. The chatbox will make clear that it is an open-source tool that can be installed on any site. 
2) Get users using messaging and configuring their profiles. It's meant to be fun and shareable. Show off NFTs / badges / Sound songs, message about them.
3) Help businesses onboard to Relay by saying that if they are in the directory then they can receive messages from web3 users / Lens users. If they give us their ENS and then come back to relay.cc or install Receiver on their site to view the messages. 

Two minor goals:
1) Serve as the notification hub for Receiver messages. One browser tab to keep open and receive notifications from conversations started on various sites with Receiver. 
2) By aggregating and curating 200+ important web3 sites, we deliver web traffic to them and become a way to message them. We become an important player in the ecosystem.
